IMMEDIATE:
fix calls in main to BW tools
fix import latencyBW...

NEXT:
1. use pings for latency
2. test reverse bandwidth
3. change iperf TCP packet sizes while testing
4. add UDP iperf
5. add double nic server to give router dhcp address

SCENARIOS:
1. normal - bw/latency plots
-- change iperf window size and plot again
-- change iperf packet length and plot again
2. congestion network with parallel iperf udp stream - bw/latency
3. near far effect to change bitrates - bw/latency
4. symmetric hidden terminal on same channel other network - bw/latency

Knobs on iperf:

Client/server
-l, --len       #[KM]    length of buffer to read or write (default 8 KB)
-w, --window    #[KM]    TCP window size (socket buffer size)
-M, --mss       #        set TCP maximum segment size (MTU - 40 bytes)

Client
-d, --dualtest           Do a bidirectional test simultaneously
-r, --tradeoff           Do a bidirectional test individually
-L, --listenport #       port to receive bidirectional tests back on

TESTS:
10: normal iperf (20) and ping (20)
11: on top of microwave iperf (10) and ping (10) -- problem with microwave ended prematurely
12: iperf udp stream going from riverside through router to mugen and vice versa (-d flag)
