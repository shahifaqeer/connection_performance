IMMEDIATE:
fix calls in main to BW tools
fix import latencyBW...

NEXT:
1. use pings for latency
2. test reverse bandwidth
3. change iperf TCP packet sizes while testing
4. add UDP iperf
5. add double nic server to give router dhcp address

SCENARIOS:
1. normal - bw/latency plots
-- change iperf window size and plot again
-- change iperf packet length and plot again
2. congestion network with parallel iperf udp stream - bw/latency
3. near far effect to change bitrates - bw/latency
4. symmetric hidden terminal on same channel other network - bw/latency
